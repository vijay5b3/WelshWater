/**
 * The resource manager is used to process the resources in the app. It can be used to upload resources to the server, update the config, and to fetch resources from the server.
 *
 * App resources refer to files used by the app, such as images, icons, and config.json. They are stored on the ArcGIS rest server associated with the app item.
 * The storage structure of the resources are as follows:
 * {
 *    resources: [
 *        { resource: 'config/config.json' , ...}, // This file is the draft version appConfig
 *        { resource: 'images/image-resources-list.json' , ...}, // This file is stored imageResources.
 *        { resource: 'images/icon-resources-list.json' , ...}, // This file is stored iconResources.
 *        { resource: 'images/widget_1/123456.jpg' , ...}, // This file is stored image item.
 *        ...
 *    ]
 * }
 *
 * These first 3 app resources are special. The config.json is the draft version appConfig.
 * The image-resources-list.json and icon-resources-list.json are used to manage other resources, we call them management resources, they don't have `ResourceItemInfo` but their content have `ResourceItemInfo` to manage the item resources.
 * All other resources are called resource items, they have `ResourceItemInfo`.
 *
 * The manager handles mapping app resource URLs to the underlying storage location. So code can refer to a normalized URL like ${appResourceUrl}/images/widget1/image.png. And the manager will handle uploading resources to the proper /images/widget1/location.
 *
 * Here is how the resources are processed:
 *  * When uploading resources, it converts files to blobs and generates blob URLs.
 *  * When saving and updating the app config, it replaces blob URLs with the corresponding resource URLs.
 *  * When fetching resources from server, it replaces `${appResourceUrl}` with portalUrl and add token to the end of the url.
